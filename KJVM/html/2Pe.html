<h4>The Second Epistle of</h4>
            <h1 id='2Pe' href='#top' title='2 Peter'>2 Peter</h1>
<h6><a class='listButton' id="summary">Summary</a>The book of 2nd Peter is a General Epistle (Apostolic Letter). It was written to all believers in general. The author is Peter who wrote it about 63-64 A.D. The key personalities are the Apostles Peter and Paul. Its purpose was to warn against the increasing number of false teachers attacking the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>•    In chapters 1-2, Peter gives guidance and reassurance to the growing church and claims that the Gospel they are preaching is of Jesus Christ. He claimed, “We were eye witnesses of His Majesty” <a href="#2Pe_1_16">(1:16)</a>, and that men who were, “Moved by the Holy Spirit” wrote all of the teachings of Scripture <a href="#2Pe_1_21">(1:21)</a>. The trouble they were dealing with was the beginning of what we now know as “Gnosticism” a philosophical principal that was hurting the churches. Peter went on to teach that in the end God would judge all of the false prophets.<br/><br/>•    Chapter 3, Peter encourages believes with the coming Day of the Lord. The Earth will receive its punishment and the righteous will dwell in the “New Heavens and the New Earth”. His final warning is critical which he claims, “Be on your guard so that you are not carried away by the error of unprincipled men” <a href="#2Pe_3_17">(3:17)</a>.“For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust” <a href="#2Pe_1_4">(1:4)</a>.</h6><ol class="collapsed"><a  class="listButton" id="outline">Outline</a><li class="hdg4"></li>
