<h4>The First Epistle of</h4>
            <h1 id='1Pe' href='#top' title='1 Peter'>1 Peter</h1>
<h6><a class='listButton' id="summary">Summary</a>The book of 1st Peter is a General Epistle (Apostolic Letter). It was written to all believers in general. The author is Peter who wrote it about 60 A.D. The key personalities are the Apostle Peter, Silas, and Mark. Its purpose was to encourage suffering Christians and to call them to personal holiness; Peter’s central focus is persecution.<br/><br/>•    Chapters 1-2, Peter addresses the issue that believers are to live a life of personal holiness as God’s people, even during times of suffering and persecution. He teaches that all Christians are to expect suffering; it is normal and Scriptural for Christians to suffer persecution and even imprisonment and death. Peter explains that our salvation in Christ is secure and that He took our sin on the cross and, “for by His wounds you were healed” <a href="#1Pe_2_24">(2:24)</a>.<br/><br/>•    In chapters 3-5, Peter explains that in living holy lives the believer is to, “sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence” <a href="#1Pe_3_15">(3:15)</a>. A part of living a holy life is obeying the commands of Christ and Peter claimed that we are obligated to preach the “Hope that is in you”. He expounds that believers should not be surprised when persecution comes upon them, “be on the alert” because Satan is continuously, “seeking whom he may devour” <a href="#1Pe_5_8">(5:8)</a>. In addition, if the believer does suffer persecution, they are to glorify God and entrust their souls to Him.</h6><ol class="collapsed"><a  class="listButton" id="outline">Outline</a><li class="hdg4"></li>
