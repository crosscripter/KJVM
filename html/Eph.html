<h6><a class='listButton' id="summary">Summary</a>"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast'' (2:8-9).<br/><br/>•    In chapters 4-5, Paul encourages the believer to “walk in a manner worthy of the calling”. Every believer has a responsibility to live as servants of Jesus Christ. In these chapters, Paul teaches that it takes hard work to be in unity with others, and that we are to be “imitators of God” <a href="#Eph_5_1">(5:1)</a>. He mentions imperative truths and advice for well functioning families, including husbands and wives who upon the oath of marriage become as “one flesh” <a href="#Eph_5_31">(5:31)</a>. Paul explains the concept of a biblical marriage. Marriage is a picture of Christ and the church (body of believers) and the way that Jesus Christ loved the church is the way that the husband must love his treasured wife, "Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her" <a href="#Eph_5_25">(5:25)</a>. Paul doesn’t end there, he goes on to reinforce that husbands are to love their wives, "as their own bodies" and also to love their wives, "even as himself (vss 28;33).When a husband learns to love his wife in this way, his wife usually has no issues fulfilling her role and even enjoys it, "the wife must see to it that she respects her husband" (vs 33).<br/><br/>• In chapter 6, Paul instructs believers how to prepare for spiritual battle by dressing in the “full armor of God” <a href="#Eph_6_11">(6:11)</a>. Prayer is the key weapon of the Christian soldier. He emphasizes his principle with the repeated statement “stand firm”.</h6><ol class="collapsed"><a  class="listButton" id="outline">Outline</a><li class="hdg4"></li>
