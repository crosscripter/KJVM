<h6><a class='listButton' id="summary">Summary</a>The genre of Joel is Narrative and Prophetic Oracle. The prophet Joel wrote it around 841-835 B.C. sometime before the fall and exiles of the Northern and Southern Kingdoms. Key personalities are Joel and the people of Judah. Its purpose was to call the Southern Kingdom to repentance or prepare for the coming judgment. Joel describes the locust that inflicts severe damage to everything in their paths, and warns that it is only the beginning of what is to come.<br/><br/>•    Chapter 1, Joel compares the destruction and judgment of God like a plague of locust. This is the warning and penalty for disobedience and evilness, “For a nation has invaded my land, mighty and without number; its teeth are the teeth of a lion, and it has the fangs of a lioness” <a href="#Joe_1_6">(1:6)</a>.<br/><br/>•    Chapter 2-3, God calls His people to repent and return, if not, they will all be judged. The promise and deliverance of the Lord is waiting and He will restore the land, Return to Me with all your heart, And with fasting, weeping and mourning; And rend your heart and not your garments.”Now return to the LORD your God, For He is gracious and compassionate, Slow to anger, abounding in lovingkindness And relenting of evil” (2:12-13).</h6><ol class="collapsed"><a  class="listButton" id="outline">Outline</a><li class="hdg4"></li>
